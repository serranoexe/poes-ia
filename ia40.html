        <p>My soul is a dark and lonely place
           <br>
           Where no light or hope can ever show
           <br>
           Though I try to keep a smiling face
           <br>
           My sorrows and despair still grow
           
           <br>
           <br>

           My tortured mind can't ever find
           <br>
           A way out of this endless night
           <br>
           And the sadness and grief that I feel inside
           <br>
           Is so strong it makes me want to take flight
           
           <br>
           <br>

           The pain that I feel deep in my core
           <br>
           Is a burden I can no longer bear
           <br>
           And I'm so cold and so very sore
           <br>
           It's a suffering no one should ever share
           
           <br>
           <br>

           This darkness that I dwell in
           <br>
           Is a prison I cannot escape
           <br>
           My pain, sorrow, and suffering
           <br>
           Will never allow me to break
           
           <br>
           <br>

           But in this bleak and dismal space
           <br>
           I will keep my faith alive
           <br>
           For I know one day soon I will find grace
           <br>
           And my future will no longer be deprived

           <br>
           <br>
