        <p>The wind is still, the birds are quiet
           <br>
           My mind is heavy, my heart is light
           <br>
           The sun is shining, the sky is clear
           <br>
           My thoughts drift away, no longer here
          
           <br>
           <br>

           The world is spinning, I stay in place
           <br>
           My life is like a long, winding race
           <br>
           I cannot keep up, I cannot keep pace
           <br>
           I am lost in the chaos, it's hard to keep face
          
           <br>
           <br>

           I search for the answers, I look for the key
           <br>
           But I am so tired, and I can barely see
           <br>
           The fog is thick, and I'm losing my way
           <br>
           I'm slipping ever closer to the dark of day
          
           <br>
           <br>

           But then I remember, I'm not alone
           <br>
           The light of the moon, the love of my home
           <br>
           My friends and family, their love carries me through
           <br>
           And I'm reminded I can make it, no matter what I do

           <br>
