        <p>We'll run a course of miles, eight days straight.
           <br>
           A journey of exploration, no time to be late.
           <br>
           We'll drive until the wheels fall off and the night's so bleak.
           <br>
           We'll search for new adventures, so little sleep.
           <br>
           We'll keep on driving, no matter the cost.
           <br>
           We'll take on the world, no matter the lost.
           <br>
           We'll never look back, we'll never slow down.
           <br>
           We'll keep the engine running and never back down.
           <br>
           We'll find that special place, the one with no name.
           <br>
           We'll never forget it, it'll live in our veins.
           <br>
           We'll keep on going, and never give in.
           <br>
           We'll take on the world and never give up the win.
           <br>
           We'll keep on running, like the wind and the sun.
           <br>
           We'll never tire, and never be done.

           <br>
