        <p>Drugs, they say, can be a curse
           <br>
           but I find that they can be a blessing.
           <br>
           For they bring a sense of release.
           <br>
           Every hit I take is a lesson.
          
           <br>
           <br>
 
           They teach me how to feel again,
           <br>
           giving me strength to face the pain.
           <br>
           And I know that I am not alone
           <br>
           for I am part of a larger game.
          
           <br>
           <br>

           My body feels alive and free
           <br>
           riding on a wave of ecstasy.
           <br>
           A sense of joy, of being whole
           <br>
           that I can never seem to find in my soul.
          
           <br>
           <br>

           I may not have the answers I seek,
           <br>
           but drugs have helped me to find a peak,
           <br>
           a place of safety, of warmth and love
           <br>
           where I can escape from all the above.
