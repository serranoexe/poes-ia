        <p>My soul is wild and free
           <br>
           as I wander down this road.
           <br>
           My heart is full of glee
           <br>
           and my spirit is aglow.
          
           <br>
           <br>

           The wind blows through my hair
           <br>
           as I take in the sun.
           <br>
           The smell of nature is in the air
           <br>
           and I am having such fun.
          
           <br>
           <br>

           The trees are swaying in the breeze,
           <br>
           the birds are singing their song.
           <br>
           The beauty of the countryside
           <br>
           makes me want to sing along.
          
           <br>
           <br>

           The road stretches far and wide
           <br>
           where it leads, I do not know,
           <br>
           but I'll keep traveling with no fear,
           <br>
           as I wander, free and slow.

           <br>
