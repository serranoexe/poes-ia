        <p>Wild fires rage,
           <br>
           Our world is in a blaze.
           <br>
           The sky is filled with smoke,
           <br>
           The air is thick and hazy.
          
           <br>
           <br>

           The flames leap and dance,
           <br>
           The heat is so intense.
           <br>
           The planet is in peril,
           <br>
           And our future is bleak.
          
           <br>
           <br>

           Oh, what have we done?
           <br>
           We have ignored the warnings,
           <br>
           And now we must face the consequences.
          
           <br>
           <br>


           For if we don't act now,
           <br>
           Our future will be lost.
           <br>
           So let us be proactive,
           <br>
           And remember the cost.
