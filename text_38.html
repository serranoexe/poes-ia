        <p>In the dark night I stand alone,
           <br>
           The fog of uncertainty surrounds me.
           <br>
           No one here to call my own,
           <br>
           My heart just aches to be free.
           
           <br>
           <br>

           The stars above, they seem so far,
           <br>
           The futureâ€™s path a mystery.
           <br>
           My dreams are kept in a jar,
           <br>
           The contents, an enigma.
           
           <br>
           <br>

           I wander through this darkened land,
           <br>
           A place of shadows and fears.
           <br>
           The answers I sought have no hand,
           <br>
           And I'm left to shed these tears.
           
           <br>
           <br>

           But in the darkness I will persist,
           <br>
           A light I will seek to find.
           <br>
           For I know I must exist,
           <br>
           Though it may be hard to define.
           
           <br>
           <br>
